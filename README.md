# PokeSpriteOrganizer

This is a tool designed mainly for Pokemon Generations 4+. It was created to better ease the development from Spritesheets to Textures. This tool does not split, cut, trim or any other image processing. It is only used for organization from a large folder of individual textures into their respective folders.

## How to use
Poke Sprite Organizer is fairly straight forward. First select the folder where all of your textures are stored.

![PokeSpriteOrganizer - Texture Select](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/PokeSpriteOrganizer/assets/73779393/e65a0701-9ab4-490c-adb2-7ae72a0c260b)
![Folder Select](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/PokeSpriteOrganizer/assets/73779393/72cac7f7-d8bf-489b-8385-e83edfe03198)
![Textures Aquired](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/PokeSpriteOrganizer/assets/73779393/dce22615-6888-4f48-96cb-1f797208c875)

Next Selected your Indexing. There are 3 different types that are currently supported; Zero-Based, One-Based, and Key-Based. If your output files from your textures include zeros before the number you can increase or decrease the index prefix, this will add zeros internally to make the Keys match.

### Optional
If you have a text file with your remapped values, you can add them here. It will generate the values and assign them top down.

Now simple select the folders you wish to separate the images into.

![PokeSpriteOrganizer - Folders Select](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/PokeSpriteOrganizer/assets/73779393/ef2fb8b7-0a3b-4b00-b62e-e512111386bb)
![Folders Select](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/PokeSpriteOrganizer/assets/73779393/07c61a55-f990-48e7-bc59-db7f00fcf331)
![Folders Selected Ready For Organization](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/PokeSpriteOrganizer/assets/73779393/3fbfe833-b31b-44e5-a98b-b40e19838179)


Before you click organize be sure that the "Keys" of your Folders are in the correct order, otherwise you will have textures going to different folders than you expect.

![PokeSpriteOrganizer - Last Changes Select](https://github.com/CorruptStudio/PokeSpriteOrganizer/assets/73779393/5a517af2-416f-4154-bf1c-67a70533d49a)

Now just click "Organize". And there you have it. This part of the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple minutes depending on how many Textures you have.
